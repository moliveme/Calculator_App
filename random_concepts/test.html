        1. JS is for adding interactivity to HTML and CSS.
        2. simply add code inside the <script></script> tags to indicate JS usage
        3. so JS can also be added in a html file internally (i.e. within the body)
        4. or externally 
        5. JS also has variables like strings, ints, booleans, etc. 
        6. if statements supported by JS, loops too
        7. can put variables into the html file that calls the js file that the code
        is written in. eg: document.getElementById('box').innerHTML = number + 5; will output 15 
        on the browser page (if number = 10).
        8. fucntions in js
        9. event listeners in js
        **** points 4+ are included as code in .js files only :)
